Electronics, wood, plastics: companies around the world are faced with a lack of materials and components to meet demand. Here&#39;s why.

Gas and electricity prices are not the only ones to soar in recent months. The costs of many raw materials and components supplying the production lines of factories around the world are also rising, slowing the production and delivery of consumer goods. Le Monde takes stock of these shortages.

What is a shortage?
We speak of shortage when there is a partial or total lack of food or goods, on the scale of a territory or a group of people. From an economic point of view, scarcity refers to the time when the demand for a commodity is greater than the supply.

These can have various causes, climatic (bad harvest), political (war situation, blockade), economic (insufficient production) or even purely speculative: the fear of running out leading to a rush on one or more products. .

At the start of the health crisis due to Covid-19, the confinement caused a frenzy to buy pulp or toilet paper, which was accentuated by the images of empty shelves, thus creating a shortage in supermarkets.

Why are there shortages now?
Because demand has picked up much more strongly than expected

After these generalized and successive shutdowns of national economies during lockdowns in 2020 and 2021, demand for manufactured products and raw materials picked up sharply, causing tensions with respect to supply below demand.

The graph below clearly shows the supply deficits encountered since 2020. The lowest level of the index was reached at the time of the first containment. Supply times were briefly shortened in the summer of 2020, before getting longer lasting until today.
